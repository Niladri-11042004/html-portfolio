<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>Hello everybody my name is Niladri Ghosh, I am in my 3rd year of college, I am currently pursuing Bachelors of 
  Technology in Electronics & Communication Engineering, from Techo Main Salt Lake.</p>

<p>I have done my schooling from the Frank Anthony Public School, Kolkata. I scored 89% in ICSE and 92% in ISC exam.</p>

<p>To be completely honest, I was not very good in studies, initially in my life but as. but as I grew up, I got motivations 
  from the very friends that I made in my school and tuition, who had help me in my studies and provided me with all sort of 
  sources and resources that was needed to score a good.</p>

<p>I liked to do coding in my school time, I had Java in our curriculum. I like it more because it did not 
  involve any sort of memorizing, it's simply writing codes and getting desired outcomes, which would encourage 
  me to do more and more coding day by day. In the 1st year of college, C programming language was there in 
  our curriculum, I did not face much of a difficulties in doing programs on C programming language, due to 
  my prior knowledge on Java. I also help my other friends to do programs, which had encourage me more 
  to do more and more coding.</p>

<p>Not only did I get very good friends in my school life but I also got good friends in my college life 
  is well they are very supportive and they helps me and guides me in all sorts of aspects of my life. 
  I would also like to mention one more thing that I am the CR of my class, being a CR of my class really 
  makes me very proud because of the very supportive friends and faculties in my college.</p>

<p>I enjoy watching movies, like Rom-coms, action, sci-fi, etc. I also like listening to soothing and soft 
  songs. I do not have a much of an interest in playing games like footballer, cricket. I visit gym almost 
  every evening. I would also like to mention that I am a foodie, I love trying out foods with new fusion
